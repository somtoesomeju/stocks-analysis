# stocks-analysis


## Overview of Project 
In this Project, I am helping Steve analyze stock data and create a report showing how the stock "DAQO" has been doing over the last few years. He needs this data to share with his parents as they want to invest in stock through him.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the data from all the stock in 2017 and 2018, refactor the data to show how well the "DAQ0" stock has been performing

## Background
Steve just graduated from college with a finance degree and his parents want to be his first clients. They are interested in renewable energy so they want to invest in the stock "DAQ0". In order for Steve to convince his parents he needs a report that shows how "DQ" has performed in comparison to other stock over the last few years.


## Results
Based on my results, I was able to replicate the same table with the refractored data. Making a few tweaks to the all stocks analysis sheet, it changed the outcome of my data. Initially, I had an error due to the fact that I did not properly loop through the output arrays. I created the arrays and did not add the iterator (i) when I was attempting to loop through the data. Upon correcting my error, the table was successfully created.

For i = 0 To 11
    
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
    Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
    Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
    
 initially, when writing this script, I got an error because I failed to add the (i) iterator. After a review, the final data was modified and corrected to include the iterator. 
 
The values in my screenshots were a little different from the module, although the format was the same at the end. I was able to get the runtime data for [2017](https://github.com/somtoesomeju/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) and [2018](https://github.com/somtoesomeju/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

From the analysis, it is clear that there are multiple ways to get to the same end result. This shows the beauty of using VBA to refactor code. The main disadvantage though is that VBA usually involves long code, so making a slight mistake in refractoring can give you an error (or false data). In relation to the original script in module 2, refractoring the data meant the data meant that the runtime was a bit faster compared to the original data. In conclusion, using VBA we can increase/decrease the runtime of data.
